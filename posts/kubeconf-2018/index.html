I&rsquo;ve decided to distill the core concepts that I think are important from the conference into this blog post.
I can categorize what the conference was trying to push into 5 concepts:

Observability is King
Do 1 Thing Well
Choose Tools Appropriately
Everyone Needs to know Cloud Ops
Be Cloud Provider Agnostic

These aren&rsquo;t new ideas but they were so prominent and spoken about in so many ways that they seemed
novel and obvious."><meta name=author content="Luke Swithenbank"><link rel=canonical href=https://lswith.io/posts/kubeconf-2018/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d6fcd20a4fb86efa4dfac8ec95da60244cc8871042183da1ef28e3a762ad79c8.css integrity="sha256-1vzSCk+4bvpN+sjsldpgJEzIhxBCGD2h7yjjp2Ktecg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://lswith.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://lswith.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://lswith.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://lswith.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://lswith.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://lswith.io/posts/kubeconf-2018/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://lswith.io/posts/kubeconf-2018/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Lswith's Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Kubeconf 2018: The Overview"><meta property="og:description" content="I attended KubeConf 2018 in Seattle a week ago.

It seemed that all the major tools and new features in Kubernetes were all about increasing visibility into the systems that you run and the systems that you rely on.\nEnvoy and Istio are chosen not only for performance reasons but because people needed a way to observe the network they rely on.\nWorking in the cloud, you quickly realise that not every scenario and failure can be tested for. It’s a much better idea to observe what is going on in production and when the alert when things fail.\nPrometheus has now been used extensively in production and has been rolled out in many, many different ways across people’s systems. It along with Jaegar seem to be where the industry is moving and consolidating around.\nEven Kubernetes has increased its metric output as it realised that it was required to better maintain the cluster.\nDo 1 Thing Well In an architecture, doing 1 thing well means making sure that each individual part of the system does 1 thing, and has a clear boundary around that 1 thing. This clear boundary means that things become easier to debug, easier to reason about, and easier to compose into something larger.\nIn the tooling space, pick the tool that is easiest to compose with other tools and that only does 1 thing. This allows you to fully leverage it and compose it into your system.\nIn business, doing 1 thing well is about focusing on what is core to your business and outsourcing what isn’t. Making sure to do 1 thing well, allows you to be agile enough to change and compose what you provide as necessary and gives focus to the product.\nBeing able to seperate out each part into the 1 thing it does also allows for a better idea of how that thing is being used. This means, that backwards compatibility becomes easier to manage and reliability then increases 10 fold.\nChoose Tools Appropriately Everyone loves tools. Everyone has too many tools. Consolidate into what is necessary, and discard what isn’t.\nChoosing the right tools is incredibily important and they should be chosen with care. An acronym that was mentioned was:\nAEIOU:\nApplicable: does this tool solve the issue at hand? Enterprise Readiness: Is this tool ready for scale? Integrate: Can this tool be easily integrated into the platform? Overhead: How much maintainance does this tool require? Useful: Is this tool actually useful? Using this acroynm helps to better evaluate if a tool is right for the job or whether doing something in house is needed.\nEveryone needs to know Cloud Ops To really embrace the cloud, you need a large amount of knowledge in using the cloud. It’s synonomous with relearning how to run a server except now its much more complicated.\nBeing able to get everyone trained up to understand how things run in the cloud (or on Kubernetes) means that it’s easier for them to reason about how the system interacts. Developers and others need to know how to run and debug their code in any environment.\nThe good thing is that now that Kubernetes is becoming the defactor standard, its becoming much more valuable to learn how things run on Kubernetes and the learnings are much more standardised and universal than ever before.\nBe Cloud Provider Agnostic Kubernetes is a great platform for shipping code anywhere. Your servers, your customer’s servers, or someone else’s. This also means that writing your code to be cloud agnostic is vital.\nIf you want to truly be able to deploy anywhere, you need to minimise your dependencies on anything that isn’t installable on kubernetes.\nThere were a few case studies about how a multitude of products were shipped on their customer’s servers through the use of kubernetes.\nHopefully, these concepts will bring the same amount of inspiration that KubeConf has done for me!\n","wordCount":"765","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2018-12-29T17:23:30+11:00","dateModified":"2018-12-29T17:23:30+11:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Luke Swithenbank"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://lswith.io/posts/kubeconf-2018/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Lswith's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://lswith.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://lswith.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://lswith.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://lswith.io/posts/ title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://lswith.io/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://lswith.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://lswith.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Kubeconf 2018: The Overview</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2018-12-29 17:23:30 +1100 AEDT'>December 29, 2018</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;765 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Luke Swithenbank&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/kubeconf-2018.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>I attended KubeConf 2018 in Seattle a week ago.
