The Challenge of Ad Hoc Team Design\nReactive or ad hoc team design often creates inefficiencies. Teams formed in response to crises—whether for middleware, database management, or specific technologies—may solve short-term problems but fail to consider the broader system. This leads to bottlenecks, blurred responsibilities, and dependency issues:\n“The first anti-pattern is ad hoc team design. Without considering the broader context of the interrelationships between teams, what seems like a natural solution might slow down delivery and eat away at the autonomy of teams.”\nInstead of patchwork fixes, organizations should focus on intentional team structures that address broader organizational needs. This involves adopting the four fundamental team topologies.\n2. Introduction to the Four Fundamental Team Types\nTo reduce complexity and promote sustainable software delivery, Team Topologies defines four primary team types:\nStream-aligned teams: Deliver value by focusing on a specific business or customer stream. Enabling teams: Help other teams adopt new practices or technologies to improve their capabilities. Complicated-subsystem teams: Manage areas of the system requiring specialized knowledge. Platform teams: Provide internal services to reduce the cognitive load on other teams. This structured approach ensures clarity in roles, responsibilities, and interactions across the organization.\n3. Stream-Aligned Teams: Delivering Value\nStream-aligned teams are the default team type in a well-structured organization. They align directly to business streams, such as customer segments, product lines, or compliance needs, enabling them to deliver a steady flow of value:\n“In a modern software organization, we expect most teams to be stream aligned. The flow of work is clear, and each stream has a steady, expectable flow of work for the stream-aligned team to prioritize.”\nKey characteristics of stream-aligned teams include:\nOwnership of live operations:\n“Stream-aligned teams follow good software-delivery practices (like continuous delivery and operability), and they are responsible for live operation.”\nMinimal hand-offs to other teams:\n“A stream-aligned team has minimal (ideally zero) hand-offs of work to other teams.”\nAutonomy in decision-making, akin to Amazon’s two-pizza-team model:\n“The teams are substantially independent, have ownership over their services, and have responsibility for the runtime success of the software they write.”\nStream-aligned teams thrive when supported by other team types, ensuring they can focus on delivering value without being bogged down by technical debt or dependencies.\n4. Enabling Teams: Bridging Gaps\nEnabling teams play a critical role in helping stream-aligned teams grow their capabilities. These teams consist of specialists who provide guidance and support, ensuring that stream-aligned teams can operate autonomously in the long term:\n“The end goal of an enabling team is to increase the autonomy of stream-aligned teams by growing their capabilities with a focus on their problems first, not the solutions per se.”\nExamples of enabling team activities include:\nKnowledge transfer, such as pairing to adopt Infrastructure-as-Code practices. Staying ahead of the curve to introduce new tools and practices: “An enabling team stays ahead of the curve in keeping abreast of new approaches, tooling, and practices in their area of expertise.”\nEnabling teams act as temporary partners, working closely with stream-aligned teams to solve specific challenges before stepping back.\n5. Complicated-Subsystem Teams: Managing Complexity\nWhen parts of a system require deep expertise, complicated-subsystem teams are created to manage them. These teams handle components that demand specialized knowledge, which would otherwise overwhelm stream-aligned teams:\n“A complicated-subsystem team is created only when a subsystem needs mostly specialized knowledge. The decision is driven by team cognitive load.”\nKey characteristics include:\nHigh collaboration with stream-aligned teams during early development phases.\nOwnership of complex subsystems to maintain speed and quality:\n“Delivery speed and quality for the subsystem is clearly higher than if/when the subsystem was being developed by a stream-aligned team.”\nBy centralizing expertise, these teams ensure complex areas of the system are managed efficiently without overburdening other teams.\n6. Platform Teams: Reducing Cognitive Load\nPlatform teams provide the foundational services that enable stream-aligned teams to work effectively and autonomously. Their focus is on creating internal platforms that streamline workflows, such as provisioning, monitoring, and deployment:\n“The purpose of a platform team is to enable stream-aligned teams to deliver work with substantial autonomy.”\nA good platform emphasizes usability and developer experience (DevEx):\n“Ease of use is fundamental for platform adoption and reflects the fact that platform teams must treat the services they offer as products.”\nKey practices include:\nCollaborating with stream-aligned teams to understand their needs. Leading by example, using the platform’s services internally. Focusing on simplicity and clarity to reduce friction: “A good platform should make it easy for Dev teams to do the right things in the right way for the organization.”\n7. Thoughts About DevOps and Support Teams\nThe Team Topologies model integrates DevOps principles by embedding operations and support responsibilities within long-lived teams. Instead of separate Ops or support teams, stream-aligned teams own their services end-to-end:\n“There is no ‘Ops’ team or ‘support’ team in the fundamental topologies, and this is deliberate. The long-lived teams building the systems are very close to the live operation of the systems they are building.”\nThis approach minimizes hand-offs, improves flow, and ensures rapid feedback from live environments. Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams exemplify how DevOps principles can be implemented effectively:\n“Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams, pioneered by Google, are really a special kind of stream-aligned team in the sense that they are responsible for the reliability of large-scale applications running in production.”\nBy integrating operations and support into the team topologies framework, organizations can break down silos and build a culture of shared ownership and accountability.\nFinal Reflections The four fundamental team types—stream-aligned, enabling, complicated-subsystem, and platform—offer a proven framework for designing effective, sustainable software delivery organizations. By embracing these topologies and integrating DevOps principles, teams can deliver value faster, reduce friction, and adapt to changing demands.\nAs Team Topologies reminds us:\n“Many organizations would benefit from increasing the clarity around the definition and purpose of their teams.”\n","wordCount":"1077","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-01-14T13:00:00+11:00","dateModified":"2025-01-14T13:00:00+11:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Luke Swithenbank"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://lswith.io/posts/designing-teams/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Lswith's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://lswith.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://lswith.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://lswith.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://lswith.io/archives/ title=archives><span>archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://lswith.io/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://lswith.io/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://lswith.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://lswith.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Designing Teams for Effective Software Delivery</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-14 13:00:00 +1100 AEDT'>January 14, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1077 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Luke Swithenbank</div></header><div class=post-content><h3 id=introduction><strong>Introduction</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h3><p>In this post, I explore how to consciously design team structures and responsibilities to enable effective, sustainable software delivery.
